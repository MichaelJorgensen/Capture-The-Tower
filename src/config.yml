# Separate gold block ids with commas
# Time limit and spawn delay is in seconds
# For the kill message, colors can be added using ^ followed by the standard color code
#  Codes are found here: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes
#  Example: ^4 - This will produce Dark Red
# Stats query the database every so often (more players = more queries)
#  If you don't want your database queried as much, disable stats
# SQL option is either SQLite or MySQL
# 
# Kits with the permission ctt.kit will be randomly selected from when a player joins a game
# Kits with the permission ctt.kit.x, where x is anything, can only be picked by a player with
#  the permission ctt.kit.x
# Kits are selected through commands, so make the name of the kit easy and with NO SPACES!!!
#  Recommendation: Use a sign command plugin to allow players to use signs at spawn to choose kits
# The syntax for the contents is ID;AMOUNT;DURABILITY
#  Note: amount and durability are not required to be given
